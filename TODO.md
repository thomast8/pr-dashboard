# PR Dashboard — TODO

## Completed
- [x] GitHub webhook support: instant PR updates via webhook receiver (`POST /api/webhooks/github`), HMAC-SHA256 signature validation, targeted single-PR and check-by-SHA sync methods, webhook CRUD on `GitHubClient`, admin API for registration/status, auto-register on repo add, auto-cleanup on repo delete, polling fallback reduced to 15 min when webhooks active (2026-03-13)
- [x] ADO Beta badges: mark all ADO-related UI surfaces (Work Items header, Azure DevOps section, Link ADO Account button) with amber "Beta" pill badges (2026-03-13)
- [x] PR label/tag support: two-way sync for 5 predefined labels (bug, enhancement, documentation, refactor, testing) between dashboard and GitHub, JSONB storage on PullRequest, colored badge pills on PR cards, toggleable label chips in PRDetailPanel, soft label filter dropdown on RepoView that dims non-matching PRs (2026-03-12)
- [x] Azure DevOps work item linking: manual linking of ADO work items to PRs from the detail panel, with search by ID or title, clickable chips linking to ADO web UI, and unlink support. ADO config via env vars (org URL, project, PAT). New WorkItemLink table with alembic migration. (2026-03-11)
- [x] Flag "Commented but No Formal Review": detect commenters who left comments (conversation or inline) without submitting a formal GitHub review, surface as amber "Commented (no review)" badge in PRDetailPanel reviewer list and "Unsubmitted review" badge in Priority Queue, +5 owner score bonus, summary stat in owner mode (2026-03-10)
- [x] Priority queue Review/Owner modes: segmented toggle splits priority queue into "Review Queue" (PRs where I'm a requested reviewer, scored by ball-in-my-court logic) and "My PRs" (PRs I authored, scored by action-required signals like failing CI, changes requested, conflicts). Mode-aware tooltips, badges, scoring guide, and summary stats. Unauthenticated users fall back to legacy scoring. Backend filtering by reviewer/author moved server-side. (2026-03-10)
- [x] PR prioritization: cross-repo priority queue ranking all open PRs by computed score (review readiness, CI, size, mergeability, age, rebase, draft penalty), stack-aware merge/review order respecting parent-child dependencies, score breakdown tooltip, new `/prioritize` page with summary bar and ranked list (2026-03-09)
- [x] Custom filter dropdowns + PR state filter + merged PR support: author filter converted to custom avatar dropdown matching reviewer style, new combined state filter (all open, needs review, reviewed, approved, changes requested, draft, recently merged), backend supports returning merged PRs via include_merged_days param, merged PR cards shown with purple border and badge (2026-03-09)
- [x] Collaborative repo ownership + dev impersonation: RepoTracker junction table lets multiple users independently track the same repo with their own token/space; sync uses token fallback across trackers; dev-mode impersonation endpoint + seed script for multi-user testing; frontend dev user switcher (2026-03-09)
- [x] Remove local overrides — sync everything with GitHub: assignees synced from GitHub during sync, assignee/reviewer changes write back to GitHub API, UserProgress table dropped (dashboard mirrors GitHub review state), card assignee display is read-only (edit in detail panel only) (2026-03-09)
- [x] Per-repo visibility (private/shared): visibility moved from spaces to individual repos, each user only sees their own repos unless explicitly shared; spaces simplified to owner-only; alembic migrations run on startup (2026-03-06)
- [x] Space visibility (private/shared): spaces default to private, users can toggle to shared so coworkers see them; repos inherit visibility from parent space; visibility filter applied to spaces and repos API endpoints (2026-03-06)
- [x] Auto-discover spaces + multi-account support: GitHubAccount model, OAuth auto-discovers orgs/personal repos, toggle spaces on/off, link multiple GitHub accounts (personal + enterprise), no manual space creation (2026-03-05)
- [x] Multi-space support with GitHub OAuth: spaces for multiple GitHub orgs/users, OAuth identity flow, per-space tokens with Fernet encryption, grouped OrgOverview, SpaceManager UI, User model replaces TeamMember (2026-03-05)
- [x] User management & PR assignment: team management modal, per-PR assignee dropdown, assignee filter that dims non-matching cards, team progress checkboxes in detail panel (2026-03-05)
- [x] Rebase detection from GitHub reviews: derive review/approval state from actual GitHub reviews, warn when PR is rebased after last approval by comparing review commit_id vs head_sha (2026-03-05)
- [x] Org repo browser: browse and track repos from configured GitHub org instead of manual input (2026-03-05)
- [x] Backend foundation: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy async + all DB models (2026-03-04)
- [x] GitHub client: async httpx wrapper for PRs, checks, reviews (2026-03-04)
- [x] Background sync service with configurable interval (2026-03-04)
- [x] Core API: repos CRUD, PR list/detail, team CRUD, progress tracking (2026-03-04)
- [x] Stack detection algorithm (BFS on head_ref/base_ref) (2026-03-04)
- [x] Stack API endpoints (2026-03-04)
- [x] SSE broadcast service for real-time updates (2026-03-04)
- [x] Auth: HMAC-signed session cookies (2026-03-04)
- [x] Frontend scaffold: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Zustand + react-query (2026-03-04)
- [x] Org overview page with repo health cards (2026-03-04)
- [x] Repo view with sortable/filterable PR table (2026-03-04)
