# PR Dashboard — TODO

## Completed
- [x] Remove local overrides — sync everything with GitHub: assignees synced from GitHub during sync, assignee/reviewer changes write back to GitHub API, UserProgress table dropped (dashboard mirrors GitHub review state), card assignee display is read-only (edit in detail panel only) (2026-03-09)
- [x] Per-repo visibility (private/shared): visibility moved from spaces to individual repos, each user only sees their own repos unless explicitly shared; spaces simplified to owner-only; alembic migrations run on startup (2026-03-06)
- [x] Space visibility (private/shared): spaces default to private, users can toggle to shared so coworkers see them; repos inherit visibility from parent space; visibility filter applied to spaces and repos API endpoints (2026-03-06)
- [x] Auto-discover spaces + multi-account support: GitHubAccount model, OAuth auto-discovers orgs/personal repos, toggle spaces on/off, link multiple GitHub accounts (personal + enterprise), no manual space creation (2026-03-05)
- [x] Multi-space support with GitHub OAuth: spaces for multiple GitHub orgs/users, OAuth identity flow, per-space tokens with Fernet encryption, grouped OrgOverview, SpaceManager UI, User model replaces TeamMember (2026-03-05)
- [x] User management & PR assignment: team management modal, per-PR assignee dropdown, assignee filter that dims non-matching cards, team progress checkboxes in detail panel (2026-03-05)
- [x] Rebase detection from GitHub reviews: derive review/approval state from actual GitHub reviews, warn when PR is rebased after last approval by comparing review commit_id vs head_sha (2026-03-05)
- [x] Org repo browser: browse and track repos from configured GitHub org instead of manual input (2026-03-05)
- [x] Backend foundation: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy async + all DB models (2026-03-04)
- [x] GitHub client: async httpx wrapper for PRs, checks, reviews (2026-03-04)
- [x] Background sync service with configurable interval (2026-03-04)
- [x] Core API: repos CRUD, PR list/detail, team CRUD, progress tracking (2026-03-04)
- [x] Stack detection algorithm (BFS on head_ref/base_ref) (2026-03-04)
- [x] Stack API endpoints (2026-03-04)
- [x] SSE broadcast service for real-time updates (2026-03-04)
- [x] Auth: HMAC-signed session cookies (2026-03-04)
- [x] Frontend scaffold: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Zustand + react-query (2026-03-04)
- [x] Org overview page with repo health cards (2026-03-04)
